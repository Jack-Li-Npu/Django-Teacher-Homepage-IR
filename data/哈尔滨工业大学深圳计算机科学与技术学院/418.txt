Research（研究兴趣）
His current research majorly focuses on the theoretical analysis and design of evolutionary algorithms. Comparing with the wide applications of evolutionary algorithms, the theoretical research falls behind. He devotes his effort to the theory analysis on evolutionary algorithms, and hopes that with the theoretical analysis, especially the runtime analysis, of evolutionary algorithms, researchers and practitioners could better understand the working principles, advantages and drawbacks of these black-box optimization algorithms so that they could design efficient algorithms for practical usage.
